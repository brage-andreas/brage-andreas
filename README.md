# Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm a self-taught developer who loves turning ideas into clean, functional code. When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me exploring music, nature, art, design, or just hanging out with friends.

* ðŸ§‘ Started programming at age 11
* ðŸ˜Š Love brainstorming and building features that improve user experience
* ðŸ˜‡ Big on collaboration, attention to detail, and creativity â€” kindness is key!
* âœ¨ Always looking to optimize and refactor for better performance and clarity
